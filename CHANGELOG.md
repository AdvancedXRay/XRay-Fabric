## [82.0.0]

Why have you bumped the version to 82.0.0? Well, it's a long story but the short and sweet of it is that 82 is the current incremental version of Minecraft for 1.20.2. For example 1.20.1 was 81. This makes it a little simpler for me to maintain versions across multiple Minecraft versions without having to worry about the version numbers conflicting.
