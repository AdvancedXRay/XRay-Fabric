Fabric Loader based XRay mod designed to aid players who don't like the ore searching process. This mod is an exact 1:1 copy of my [Advanced XRay Forge Mod](https://github.com/advancedxray/XRay-Mod/) which is typically the more up-to-date version of the mod.

## Features
Advanced XRay Fabric Edition is a feature rich XRay / Block ESP mod designed to aid players in the block searching process. I've designed the mod to be as user friendly as possible. Out of the box you'll have *Easy to use GUI for adding, deleting and editing block you want to find*, *Full RGB color picker support*, *Searchable block list with in-hand and in-world options for adding blocks*, *Json Stored list to share and edit easily outside of the game*.

## How to use

**Using XRay**

*Please note that these aren't always the ones set by default. Be sure to check your controls settings under `XRay` to find the correct keys*

- Press `Backslash` to toggle XRay `ON/OFF`
- Press `Z` to open the `selection & settings` Gui 

**Adding Blocks**

- Open the GUI Editor pressing `[Default] Z`
- Select the method you'd like to use to add a block, either From hand, What you can see, or By searching a list
- Modify the Name, Color, and anything else you'd like to change
- Click add and Enable the Block

**Editing Blocks**

- Shift Right click on any item in the GUI and edit as needed
- Click save and the changed will be applied

## Use on public servers

I **DO NOT** support the use of this mod on any public servers which do not allow this kind of mod. The mod **does** work on servers but I do not approve of, and will not, support anyone that attempts to use this mod on servers. I **do not** have the time to review each issue; I will simply close any issue with server connections in the crash log. 

If you wish to use this mod on private servers then that's on you. If you use this on public servers and are banned then that's on you and I will **not** support your use of this mod in that way.
